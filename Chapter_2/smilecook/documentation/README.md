## Smilecook recipe platform

I have created an API for an application named _**Smilecook**_ to share recipes with everyone.
Where can create a account and as the name implies share recipes on the platform.

To test the application you can use an application named PostMan.
For the database I have used PostgreSql.

The overall strucuture of the project:
